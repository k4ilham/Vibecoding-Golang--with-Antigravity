### 1. Check and Clear Ports
Before starting the applications, identify and terminate any processes running on ports `8080` (Backend) and `5173` (Frontend).

**Command (macOS/Linux):**
```bash
# Check and kill port 8080 (Backend)
lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true

# Check and kill port 5173 (Frontend)
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true
```

### 2. Start Backend
Navigate to the `backend` directory and run the Go application.

**Commands:**
```bash
cd backend
go run cmd/main.go
```

### 3. Start Frontend
Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run the Vite development server.

**Commands:**
